## My process
1. Downloaded all the files including the Figma file
2. Started with the top (hero) section and styled first for desktop, then for mobile
3. Used multiple sites (MDN, W3 Schools, Stackoverflow, etc.) to figure out how to style the page.
4. After realizing media queries would be easier with mobile, for the remaining sections I 
followed a "mobile first" development process.
5. As I worked through each section, I set the display to none for the previous sections so I could
focust on the current section.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Scss and CSS custom properties
- Javascript (just for the 'hero section' menu)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
The main thing I learned was styling for different screen sizes with some of the more complex components (especially images and background images).

I've gained a much better understanding of display and positioning to lay out the page and components.  I've been using CSS frameworks which make a lot of this easier but I decided to go with pure CSS to help me gain a thorough understanding of what's under the covers of the CSS frameworks.

### Continued development

I need to continue learning how to create responsive layouts without too many media queries.  Specifically, dynamically sizing layouts as the viewport size changes.

I also need to figure out how to size SVG images and change the positioning as the viewport size changes.  For this project I basically played with different values for 1440px desktop and 375px mobile until it matched the design. The user has different sized screen the images won't fit properly.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference) - This is my go to for specific CSS syntax, properties etc.  Great for understanding all of the different styling options and how to apply them. Some of the tutorials are Ok.
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - Although it's not a favorite of others I like it because it provides pretty good tutorials as well as examples that allow you to try the solution in a browser.  Whenever I want to understand how to adjust for my use I copy and paste the HTML, CSS and JS into my IDE, launch it with Live Server and then inspect the different elements and CSS.  From there I can start playing with the properties/values.
- [Stackoverflow] - I use Stackoverflow for "how to's" and whenever I encounter a problem
- [CSS Tricks] - (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is a real useful article on all things CSS Grid
